# Cryptography and Cybersecurity Unit 1

### 1. Question:
**What is the relationship between a plaintext and a ciphertext?**

**Answer:** Ciphertext depends on the algorithm ✅  
**Explanation:** The ciphertext length and form depend on the encryption method used. Padding, encoding, and cryptographic schemes affect output size.

### 2. Question:
**Which is a key difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption?**

**Answer:** Symmetric uses one key; asymmetric uses two ✅  
**Explanation:** Symmetric encryption uses a single shared key, while asymmetric encryption uses a pair of public and private keys.
